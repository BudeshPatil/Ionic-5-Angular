## Software required to run it...

1. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Nodejs has node package manager installed in it. Which helps to run the ionic & angular projects.

2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

For code editing / viewing. I recommend it, as it has many builtin functionality like git, svn, spinets, many extensions which help you to code faster, terminal integrated in it and many more..


2. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

For viewing, debugging, performance and many functionality.
It's a great development tool for a front-end developer.
